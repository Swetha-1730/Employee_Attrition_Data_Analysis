## **Project Overview**
- This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to identify factors contributing to high turnover rates in a company.
- Attrition negatively impacts productivity, team morale, and operational costs.
- The analysis aims to uncover key drivers behind employee attrition, providing actionable insights to help reduce turnover and improve retention.

## **Business Problem Statement**
- The company faces a **15% annual attrition rate**, resulting in substantial financial losses due to the cost of replacing employees (1.5 to 2 times the annual salary).
- The goal is to reduce the attrition rate below **10%** by identifying the main factors driving employee departures.

## **Dataset**
- The dataset includes information from XYZ Company with **4,410 employee records** and **26 attributes**.
- Key features:
  - Age, income, job role, job satisfaction, work-life balance.

## **Tools Used**
- **Python**: For data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards

## **Data Cleaning**
- Dropped unnecessary columns with constant values.
- Used mean imputation to fill in missing data.
- No duplicate entries were found.

## **Key Metrics**
- **Attrition Rate**: 16.12%
- **Retention Rate**: 83.88%
- **Average Salary**: ₹65,029.31
- **Average Performance Rating**: 3.15

## **Analysis Insights**
- **Departments**: Research & Development had the highest attrition rate (63.71%), followed by Sales (28.27%).
- **Demographics**: Higher attrition among younger employees (18-22 years) and single employees (25.53%).
- **Financial Incentives**: Higher salary hikes don’t always reduce attrition rates.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance significantly increase attrition rates.
- **Commute**: Longer commute distances correlate with higher attrition.

- **Limited Scope**: The analysis focuses on internal data, excluding external industry trends or economic factors.
- **Historical Data**: Analysis is based on past data and may not reflect real-time changes.
