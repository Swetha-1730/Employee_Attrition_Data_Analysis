**Employee Attrition Analysis:**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to identify factors contributing to high turnover rates in a company. Attrition negatively impacts productivity, team morale, and operational costs. The analysis aims to uncover key drivers behind employee attrition, providing actionable insights to help reduce turnover and improve retention.

**Business Problem Statement:**
The company faces a 15% annual attrition rate, resulting in substantial financial losses due to the cost of replacing employees (1.5 to 2 times the annual salary) and the impact on productivity. Our goal is to reduce the attrition rate below 10% by identifying the main factors driving employee departures.

**Dataset:**
The dataset includes information from XYZ Company with 4,410 employee records and 26 attributes. Key features include:

Age, income, job role, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.

**Tools Used:**
Python: Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Pandas: Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Power BI: Interactive dashboards

**Data Cleaning:**
Dropped unnecessary columns with constant values.
Used mean imputation for missing data.
No duplicate entries were found.

**Key Metrics:**
Attrition Rate: 16.12%
Retention Rate: 83.88%
Average Salary: ₹65,029.31
Average Performance Rating: 3.15

**Analysis Insights:**
Departments: Research & Development had the highest attrition rate (63.71%), followed by Sales (28.27%).
Demographics: Attrition is higher among younger employees (18-22 years) and single employees (25.53%).
Financial Incentives: Higher salary hikes don’t always lead to lower attrition.
Job Satisfaction: Low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance significantly increase attrition rates.
Commute: Longer commute distances are correlated with higher attrition.

**Recommendations:**
Enhance Employee Engagement: Improve job satisfaction and work-life balance for younger and single employees.
Review Financial Incentives: Offer competitive salary hikes and stock options to retain talent.
Support Career Development: Provide clear paths for promotion and skill development.
Improve Work Environment: Focus on creating a positive work culture.
Optimize Commute and Travel Policies: Implement flexible work arrangements to reduce frequent travel and commuting.

**Limitations:**
Data quality issues, including missing values and inaccuracies, could affect the analysis.
The scope focuses on internal data, excluding external market conditions.
The analysis is based on historical data, and real-time changes are not captured.
